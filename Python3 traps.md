well, to begin with, when i started learning python i did not think of upload all the notes up to github.
but now it seems to be a good idea to fullfill my repo. cuz, i have decided to devote myself into this area.
apparently i am just trying my best to write this all jorney in english, as a perfect way to train myself, not just my SC skills, and my
english technique...
about the first few notes, well, i think i will not be able to upload them to here. so i am gonna just start taking notes on github from
now on.
lowwer caps will be my first choice, cuz, i think no one is gonna to be able to read this..
what if someone actually find this page? oh plz, if you find something like a typo or misspell in this page.
ignore it.
